## Usage

Set `resources` to an array of Kubernetes Resources to inject into the Helm Release.

Example:

```yaml
# values.yaml

resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mysecret
    type: Opaque
    data:
      username: YWRtaW4=
      password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: my-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: MyApp
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 9376
```

## Upgrading

We recommend that you pin the version of the Chart that you deploy. You can use the `--version` flag with `helm install` and `helm upgrade` to specify a chart version constraint.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Changes to the version of the application (the `appVersion`) that the Chart deploys will generally result in a patch version bump for the Chart. Breaking changes to the Chart or its `values.yaml` interface will be reflected with a major version bump.

We do not recommend that you upgrade the application by overriding `image.tag`. Instead, use the version of the Chart that is built for your desired `appVersion`.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| resources | list | `[]` | Resources in the release. Each entry should be YAML for a valid Kubernetes Resource. |
