## Upgrading

We recommend that you pin the version of the Chart that you deploy. You can use the `--version` flag with `helm install` and `helm upgrade` to specify a chart version constraint.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Changes to the version of the application (the `appVersion`) that the Chart deploys will generally result in a patch version bump for the Chart. Breaking changes to the Chart or its `values.yaml` interface will be reflected with a major version bump.

We do not recommend that you upgrade the application by overriding `image.tag`. Instead, use the version of the Chart that is built for your desired `appVersion`.
